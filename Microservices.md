# MICROSERVICES

## Introduction

Microservices or Microservice Architecture is an approach to develop applications which are loosely coupled and highly maintainable. Each service or functionality is considered as a separate microservice and can be tested and deployed independently.

## What is an application architecture?

An application architecture is a roadmap to design and build your application so you follow best practices and build an application that is well structured.

Some major types of application architectures:

1.  Monolith and N-tier (tightly couples)
2.  Microservices (Decoupled )
3.  Event driven and Service Oriented (Loosely coupled)

These are commonly practiced software development architectures, you can select whether to start with any of the architecture depending on the requirements of the application and update release cycle of your application.

## Why Microservices?

Microservice architecture is an approach that emphasizes on breaking down application into self contained services supporting faster release cycles rather than creating a Giant code base which makes the ability to respond to rapid change laborious. There are several reasons to choose microservice architecture over traditional monoliths is that when working in an environment where many teams are involved in development and requires continuous and rapid updates.You can have separate teams for each functionality as every service is separate and the team is responsible for development, testing, deployment and handling failures.

Microservices are part of a large shift in IT industries towards DevOps culture where developers and operations teams work together to produce an application which supports a rapid or sometimes continuous release cycle. The DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT operations, so they can develop, test, and release software frequently and more reliably.
